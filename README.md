# Math library for numerical experiments

This project began when I was building a [neural network](https://github.com/victor99pekk/c_neural_network?tab=readme-ov-file#c_neural_network) from scratch in C and needed a solid library for matrix operations. Since then, I’ve continued expanding it with additional matrix utilities and numerical algorithms, it's been a way to experiment with the math I study at university by turning ideas into code. It keeps growing as I explore new and revisit old areas of mathematics. Writing it in C has been a great way to deepen my understanding and stay close to the underlying computations.

**math_lib** is a small C toolkit for quick experiments in linear algebra and numerical methods. It includes `matrix utilities` (allocation, operations, Gaussian elimination, least-squares, Gram–Schmidt), numerical algorithms like `adaptive Simpson’s`, and a simple `DFT implementation`.
