# Math library for numerical experiments

This project began as a sandbox for experimenting with the math I studied at university—turning ideas into working code—and it continues to grow as I explore new concepts. Writing it in C has been a great way to deepen my understanding and stay close to the underlying computations.

**matrix_framework** is a small C toolkit for quick experiments in linear algebra and numerical methods. It includes matrix utilities (allocation, operations, Gaussian elimination, least-squares, Gram–Schmidt) and a simple DFT implementation. The project keeps evolving as I experiment with new mathematical ideas.
