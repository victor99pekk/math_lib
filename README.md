# Math library for numerical experiments

This project started as a way of experimenting with math I study at university, turning ideas into code. And it continues to grow as I study new and revisit old areas of maths. Writing it in C has been a great way to deepen my understanding and stay close to the underlying computations.

**math_lib** is a small C toolkit for quick experiments in linear algebra and numerical methods. It includes `matrix utilities` (allocation, operations, Gaussian elimination, least-squares, Gramâ€“Schmidt), numerical algorithms like `adaptive simpson's` and a simple `DFT implementation`.
